- **Volume:** Massive amounts of data
- **Velocity:** High speed of data generation and processing
- **Variety:** Different types and formats of data (structured, unstructured, semi-structured)

Additional characteristics sometimes include Veracity (data quality) and Value (usefulness of the data).

### 12. What is the difference between an API and Microservices?

**Answer:**
- **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how requests and responses should be formatted and processed.

- **Microservices:** An architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate through APIs. Each microservice focuses on a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

APIs are often used as the communication method between microservices, but they're not the same thing. An API is an interface, while microservices are an architectural approach.

### 13. What is RESTful Architecture and why is it commonly used in web development?

**Answer:**
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Key characteristics:
- Stateless: Each request contains all information needed
- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Resources are identified by URLs
- Responses typically in JSON or XML format

It's commonly used because it's:
- Simple and standardized
- Scalable and stateless
- Compatible with web browsers
- Language and platform independent
- Widely supported by tools and frameworks

### 14. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?

**Answer:**
- **SQL (Relational) Databases:**
  - Store data in structured tables with rows and columns
  - Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for queries
  - Have predefined schemas
  - Ensure ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

- **NoSQL (Non-relational) Databases:**
  - Store data in various formats (documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.)
  - Don't require a fixed schema
  - Typically scale horizontally more easily
  - Often sacrifice some consistency for performance and scalability
  - Examples: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph), Cassandra (column-family)

### 15. What is Indexing in Databases and why is it important?

**Answer:**
Indexing is a data structure technique that improves the speed of data retrieval operations in a database. It works similar to an index in a book, allowing the database to find data without scanning the entire table.

Importance:
- Dramatically speeds up query performance
- Reduces disk I/O and CPU usage
- Enables efficient sorting and grouping
- Helps enforce uniqueness constraints

However, indexes also have costs:
- Take up storage space
- Slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes)
- Require maintenance

### 16. What is ETL?

**Answer:**
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load - a three-step process used to collect data from various sources, transform it into a suitable format, and load it into a target database or data warehouse:

- **Extract:** Collect data from various source systems
- **Transform:** Convert, clean, filter, enrich, and prepare the data for analysis
- **Load:** Insert the processed data into the target system (typically a data warehouse)

ETL is crucial for business intelligence, data migration, and creating consolidated data repositories for analysis.

### 17. What is Data Warehousing and how is it different from a standard database?

**Answer:**
- **Data Warehousing:** A system that stores large volumes of historical data from multiple sources in a format optimized for analysis and reporting.

- **Standard Database (OLTP - Online Transaction Processing):** Designed for day-to-day operations and transaction processing.

Key differences:
- **Purpose:** Data warehouses are for analysis; standard databases are for operations
- **Data structure:** Data warehouses use denormalized schemas; standard databases use normalized schemas
- **Query type:** Data warehouses handle complex analytical queries; standard databases handle simple transactional queries
- **Update frequency:** Data warehouses are updated in batches; standard databases are updated continuously
- **Historical data:** Data warehouses store historical data; standard databases focus on current data

### 18. What is the difference between IaaS and PaaS?

**Answer:**
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage applications, data, runtime, middleware, and operating systems, while the provider manages virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.
  - Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VMs

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
  - Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service

The key difference is the level of management: IaaS gives you more control but requires more management, while PaaS abstracts away more of the infrastructure but gives you less control.

### 19. What is an IP Address?

**Answer:**
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions:

- Network interface identification
- Location addressing

There are two versions:
- **IPv4:** Uses a 32-bit format (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6:** Uses a 128-bit format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

IP addresses can be static (fixed) or dynamic (changing periodically).

### 20. What is the role of DevOps in modern software development teams?

Common SDLC models include Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and DevOps.

### 27. What is the difference between SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS?

**Answer:**
These are the three main service models in cloud computing:

- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users simply access the software via a web browser.
  - Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure.
  - Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage applications, data, runtime, middleware, and OS.
  - Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VMs

The key difference is how much the provider manages versus how much the user manages.

### 28. What is Containerization and what is Docker?

**Answer:**
- **Containerization:** A lightweight form of virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies (libraries, binaries, configuration files) into a single unit called a container. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.

- **Docker:** The most popular containerization platform that allows developers to build, package, and distribute applications as containers. Docker provides tools to create, deploy, and run containers across different environments consistently.

Benefits include consistent environments, efficient resource usage, isolation, portability, and scalability.

### 29. What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?

**Answer:**
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "smart" or "intelligent."

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where machines learn from data without being explicitly programmed. They improve their performance with experience.

- **Deep Learning:** A specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data. It's particularly powerful for processing unstructured data like images, sound, and text.

The relationship is hierarchical: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.

### 30. What is the difference between Front-End, Back-End, and Full-Stack Developers?

- **Full-Stack Developer:** Comfortable working on both front-end and back-end aspects of an application. Can handle the entire development process from user interface to database management.

### 31. What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?

**Answer:**
Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The process follows a cycle:

1. Write a test for a new feature
2. Run the test (it should fail since the feature doesn't exist yet)
3. Write the minimum code needed to pass the test
4. Run the test again (it should pass)
5. Refactor the code while ensuring tests still pass
6. Repeat

Benefits include better code quality, built-in testing, clearer requirements, and safer refactoring.

### 32. What is the difference between UI and UX?

**Answer:**
- **UI (User Interface):** The visual elements users interact with in a digital product. It focuses on the look and layout of an application, including buttons, icons, spacing, typography, color schemes, and responsive design.

- **UX (User Experience):** The overall experience a user has with a product. It focuses on the entire user journey, including ease of use, accessibility, efficiency, and how the product makes users feel.

Simply put: UI is what users see and interact with; UX is how they feel about the interaction.

### 33. What is a REST API?

**Answer:**
REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources.

Key characteristics:
- **Stateless:** Each request contains all information needed
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Separation of concerns
- **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached
- **Uniform Interface:** Standardized way to interact with resources
- **Layered System:** Client can't tell if it's connected directly to the end server

REST APIs typically use HTTP methods:
- GET (retrieve data)
- POST (create data)
- PUT/PATCH (update data)
- DELETE (remove data)

### 34. What is the difference between a Framework and a Library?

**Answer:**
- **Library:** A collection of pre-written code that developers can call when they need specific functionality. The developer controls when and where to call the library.
  - Example: jQuery, React, Lodash

- **Framework:** A more comprehensive set of tools and guidelines that provides a foundation for developing applications. The framework controls the flow of the application and calls the developer's code when needed (inversion of control).
  - Example: Angular, Django, Ruby on Rails

The key difference is in control flow: with libraries, you call the code; with frameworks, the code calls you.

### 35. What is Scrum?

**Answer:**
Scrum is an agile framework for managing complex projects, particularly software development. Key elements include:

- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
- **Events:** Sprint (1-4 week timeboxed iteration), Daily Scrum (15-minute daily meeting), Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog (prioritized feature list), Sprint Backlog (items selected for the current sprint), Increment (product version at the end of a sprint)

Scrum emphasizes empirical process control, transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

### 36. What is the difference between a Bug and a Feature?

**Answer:**
- **Bug:** An error, flaw, or fault in the software that causes it to behave in unintended ways or produce incorrect results. Bugs represent functionality that doesn't work as designed or expected.

- **Feature:** A planned, intentional functionality or characteristic of the software. Features represent new capabilities or improvements that add value to the product.

Sometimes the line blurs when an unexpected behavior is later accepted as desirable (a "bug" becomes a "feature").

### 37. What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?

**Answer:**
A Database Management System is software that manages databases, providing an interface for users and applications to store, retrieve, update, and manage data. Key functions include:

- Data storage, retrieval, and update

- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** An extension of HTTP that uses encryption for secure communication. It uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt the data.

Key differences:
- **Security:** HTTPS encrypts data; HTTP transmits in plaintext
- **Port:** HTTP uses port 80; HTTPS uses port 443
- **URL prefix:** HTTP uses "http://"; HTTPS uses "https://"
- **Authentication:** HTTPS verifies the identity of the website through certificates
- **SEO:** HTTPS is favored by search engines and may improve rankings

### 41. What is a Firewall?

**Answer:**
A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

Firewalls can:
- Block access to malicious websites
- Prevent unauthorized access to private networks
- Filter traffic based on source, destination, content, or application
- Log network activity for security analysis
- Protect against various cyber threats

Types include packet-filtering firewalls, stateful inspection firewalls, proxy firewalls, next-generation firewalls (NGFW), and web application firewalls (WAF).

### 42. What is the difference between a Compiler and an Interpreter?

**Answer:**
- **Compiler:** Translates the entire source code into machine code or intermediate code before execution. The resulting executable file can be run multiple times without recompilation.
  - Examples: C, C++, Rust compilers

- **Interpreter:** Translates and executes the source code line by line at runtime, without creating an intermediate executable file.
  - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby interpreters

Key differences:
- **Execution:** Compilers translate once, then execute; interpreters translate and execute simultaneously
- **Error detection:** Compilers detect errors before runtime; interpreters detect errors during execution
- **Speed:** Compiled code generally runs faster; interpreted code is slower but more flexible
- **Platform independence:** Compiled code is platform-specific; interpreted code is more portable

### 43. What is a Data Lake vs. a Data Warehouse?

  - Pros: Single codebase, access to some device features, cheaper than native
  - Cons: Performance not as good as native, compromised user experience
  - Examples: Built with frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Ionic

### 46. What is a Microservices Architecture?

**Answer:**
Microservices architecture is an approach to software development where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate through well-defined APIs. Each service:

- Focuses on a single business function
- Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- Is owned by a small team
- Has its own database or data storage
- Communicates with other services through lightweight protocols (often HTTP/REST)

Contrast this with monolithic architecture, where all functionality is contained in a single application.

Benefits include improved scalability, flexibility in technology choices, easier maintenance, and better fault isolation.

### 47. What is Kubernetes?
