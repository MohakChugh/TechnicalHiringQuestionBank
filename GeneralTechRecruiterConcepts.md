Additional characteristics sometimes include Veracity (data quality) and Value (usefulness of the data).

### 12. What is the difference between an API and Microservices?

**Answer:**
- **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how requests and responses should be formatted and processed.

- **Microservices:** An architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate through APIs. Each microservice focuses on a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

APIs are often used as the communication method between microservices, but they're not the same thing. An API is an interface, while microservices are an architectural approach.

### 13. What is RESTful Architecture and why is it commonly used in web development?

**Answer:**
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Key characteristics:
- Stateless: Each request contains all information needed
- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Resources are identified by URLs
- Responses typically in JSON or XML format

It's commonly used because it's:
- Simple and standardized
- Scalable and stateless
- Compatible with web browsers
- Language and platform independent
- Widely supported by tools and frameworks

### 14. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?

**Answer:**
- **SQL (Relational) Databases:**
  - Store data in structured tables with rows and columns
  - Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for queries
  - Have predefined schemas
  - Ensure ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

- **NoSQL (Non-relational) Databases:**
  - Store data in various formats (documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.)
  - Don't require a fixed schema
  - Typically scale horizontally more easily
  - Often sacrifice some consistency for performance and scalability
  - Examples: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph), Cassandra (column-family)

### 15. What is Indexing in Databases and why is it important?

**Answer:**
Indexing is a data structure technique that improves the speed of data retrieval operations in a database. It works similar to an index in a book, allowing the database to find data without scanning the entire table.

Importance:
- Dramatically speeds up query performance
- Reduces disk I/O and CPU usage
- Enables efficient sorting and grouping
- Helps enforce uniqueness constraints

However, indexes also have costs:
- Take up storage space
- Slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes)
- Require maintenance

### 16. What is ETL?

**Answer:**
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load - a three-step process used to collect data from various sources, transform it into a suitable format, and load it into a target database or data warehouse:

- **Extract:** Collect data from various source systems
- **Transform:** Convert, clean, filter, enrich, and prepare the data for analysis
- **Load:** Insert the processed data into the target system (typically a data warehouse)

ETL is crucial for business intelligence, data migration, and creating consolidated data repositories for analysis.

### 17. What is Data Warehousing and how is it different from a standard database?

**Answer:**
- **Data Warehousing:** A system that stores large volumes of historical data from multiple sources in a format optimized for analysis and reporting.

- **Standard Database (OLTP - Online Transaction Processing):** Designed for day-to-day operations and transaction processing.

Key differences:
- **Purpose:** Data warehouses are for analysis; standard databases are for operations
- **Data structure:** Data warehouses use denormalized schemas; standard databases use normalized schemas
- **Query type:** Data warehouses handle complex analytical queries; standard databases handle simple transactional queries
- **Update frequency:** Data warehouses are updated in batches; standard databases are updated continuously
- **Historical data:** Data warehouses store historical data; standard databases focus on current data

### 18. What is the difference between IaaS and PaaS?

**Answer:**
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage applications, data, runtime, middleware, and operating systems, while the provider manages virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.
  - Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VMs

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
  - Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service

The key difference is the level of management: IaaS gives you more control but requires more management, while PaaS abstracts away more of the infrastructure but gives you less control.

### 19. What is an IP Address?

**Answer:**
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions:

- Network interface identification
- Location addressing

There are two versions:
- **IPv4:** Uses a 32-bit format (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6:** Uses a 128-bit format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

IP addresses can be static (fixed) or dynamic (changing periodically).

### 20. What is the role of DevOps in modern software development teams?

  - Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure.
  - Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage applications, data, runtime, middleware, and OS.
  - Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VMs

The key difference is how much the provider manages versus how much the user manages.

### 28. What is Containerization and what is Docker?

**Answer:**
- **Containerization:** A lightweight form of virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies (libraries, binaries, configuration files) into a single unit called a container. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.

- **Docker:** The most popular containerization platform that allows developers to build, package, and distribute applications as containers. Docker provides tools to create, deploy, and run containers across different environments consistently.

Benefits include consistent environments, efficient resource usage, isolation, portability, and scalability.

### 29. What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?

**Answer:**
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "smart" or "intelligent."

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where machines learn from data without being explicitly programmed. They improve their performance with experience.

- **Deep Learning:** A specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data. It's particularly powerful for processing unstructured data like images, sound, and text.

The relationship is hierarchical: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.

### 30. What is the difference between Front-End, Back-End, and Full-Stack Developers?

### 31. What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?

**Answer:**
Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The process follows a cycle:

1. Write a test for a new feature
2. Run the test (it should fail since the feature doesn't exist yet)
3. Write the minimum code needed to pass the test
4. Run the test again (it should pass)
5. Refactor the code while ensuring tests still pass
6. Repeat

Benefits include better code quality, built-in testing, clearer requirements, and safer refactoring.

### 32. What is the difference between UI and UX?

**Answer:**
- **UI (User Interface):** The visual elements users interact with in a digital product. It focuses on the look and layout of an application, including buttons, icons, spacing, typography, color schemes, and responsive design.

- **UX (User Experience):** The overall experience a user has with a product. It focuses on the entire user journey, including ease of use, accessibility, efficiency, and how the product makes users feel.

Simply put: UI is what users see and interact with; UX is how they feel about the interaction.

### 33. What is a REST API?

REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources.

Key characteristics:
- **Stateless:** Each request contains all information needed
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Separation of concerns
- **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached
- **Uniform Interface:** Standardized way to interact with resources
- **Layered System:** Client can't tell if it's connected directly to the end server

REST APIs typically use HTTP methods:
- GET (retrieve data)
- POST (create data)
- PUT/PATCH (update data)
- DELETE (remove data)

### 34. What is the difference between a Framework and a Library?

**Answer:**
- **Library:** A collection of pre-written code that developers can call when they need specific functionality. The developer controls when and where to call the library.
  - Example: jQuery, React, Lodash

- **Framework:** A more comprehensive set of tools and guidelines that provides a foundation for developing applications. The framework controls the flow of the application and calls the developer's code when needed (inversion of control).
  - Example: Angular, Django, Ruby on Rails

The key difference is in control flow: with libraries, you call the code; with frameworks, the code calls you.

### 35. What is Scrum?

**Answer:**
Scrum is an agile framework for managing complex projects, particularly software development. Key elements include:

- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
- **Events:** Sprint (1-4 week timeboxed iteration), Daily Scrum (15-minute daily meeting), Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog (prioritized feature list), Sprint Backlog (items selected for the current sprint), Increment (product version at the end of a sprint)

Scrum emphasizes empirical process control, transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

### 36. What is the difference between a Bug and a Feature?

**Answer:**
- **Bug:** An error, flaw, or fault in the software that causes it to behave in unintended ways or produce incorrect results. Bugs represent functionality that doesn't work as designed or expected.

- **Feature:** A planned, intentional functionality or characteristic of the software. Features represent new capabilities or improvements that add value to the product.

Sometimes the line blurs when an unexpected behavior is later accepted as desirable (a "bug" becomes a "feature").

### 37. What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?

- Containerization: Packaging software in standardized units for consistent deployment
- Dynamic orchestration: Actively managing containers using tools like Kubernetes
- DevOps practices: Automating and integrating development and operations
- Continuous delivery: Frequently releasing small, incremental changes
- Scalable architecture: Designed to handle growth and variable workloads

Cloud Native applications are designed to be resilient, manageable, and observable, allowing for rapid changes and optimization. They're built to thrive in the dynamic, distributed environments of modern cloud platforms.

### 55. What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?

**Answer:**
- **Authentication:** The process of verifying who someone is. It confirms the identity of a user, system, or entity.
  - Example: Logging into a system with username and password
  - Question it answers: "Who are you?"
  - Methods include: Passwords, biometrics, security tokens, certificates

- **Authorization:** The process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. It determines permissions and access rights.
  - Example: Determining if a logged-in user can access, edit, or delete specific data
  - Question it answers: "What are you allowed to do?"
  - Implemented through: Access control lists, role-based access control, policies

In simple terms, authentication confirms identity, while authorization grants permission. Authentication always comes first, followed by authorization.

### 56. What is a Domain Name System (DNS)?

**Answer:**
The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet's phone book. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other.

Key components:
- **Domain names:** Hierarchical, human-readable addresses
- **DNS servers:** Store and provide domain name information
- **DNS records:** Different types of data associated with domain names (A, CNAME, MX, etc.)
- **DNS resolution:** The process of converting a domain name to an IP address

When you enter a website URL in your browser, a DNS lookup occurs behind the scenes to find the corresponding IP address, allowing your browser to connect to the correct web server.

DNS is essential because it allows people to use memorable domain names instead of having to remember numeric IP addresses.

### 57. What is a Load Balancer?

**Answer:**
A load balancer is a device or software that distributes network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It acts as a traffic cop, routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests.

Key functions:
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers
- Ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to servers that are online
- Provides the flexibility to add or subtract servers as demand dictates
- Can perform health checks on servers
- May handle SSL termination to offload encryption/decryption work

Common load balancing methods include:
- Round robin (rotating through servers sequentially)
- Least connections (sending to the server with fewest active connections)
- IP hash (using the client's IP address to determine which server receives the request)

Load balancers are crucial for high-traffic websites, applications, and other computing resources.

### 58. What is Responsive Web Design?

**Answer:**
Responsive Web Design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. It ensures that websites look and function properly regardless of whether they're viewed on a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

Key principles:
- **Fluid grid layouts:** Using relative units (percentages) rather than fixed units (pixels)
- **Flexible images:** Sizing images relative to their containing element
- **Media queries:** CSS technique to apply different styles based on device characteristics
- **Mobile-first approach:** Designing for mobile devices first, then enhancing for larger screens

Benefits include:
- Better user experience across devices
- Reduced development and maintenance costs (one site instead of multiple)
- Improved SEO (Google favors mobile-friendly websites)
- Future-proofing as new devices with different screen sizes emerge

Responsive design has become standard practice as mobile internet usage has surpassed desktop usage globally.

### 59. What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

**Answer:**
Progressive Web Apps are web applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. They combine the best features of websites and mobile applications.

Key characteristics:
- **Progressive:** Work for every user, regardless of browser choice
- **Responsive:** Fit any form factor (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- **Connectivity independent:** Function offline or with poor network conditions
- **App-like:** Feel like an app with app-style interactions and navigation
- **Fresh:** Always up-to-date due to the service worker update process
- **Safe:** Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping
- **Discoverable:** Identifiable as "applications" by search engines
- **Re-engageable:** Can send push notifications
- **Installable:** Can be added to the home screen without an app store
- **Linkable:** Can be shared via URL

PWAs offer the convenience of web access with many capabilities previously only available to native apps, bridging the gap between web and mobile applications.

### 60. What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?

**Answer:**
A Single Page Application is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without reloading the entire page. This creates a more fluid user experience similar to a desktop application.

Key characteristics:
- Loads all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on the initial page load
- Subsequent content is loaded dynamically using JavaScript
- Page never fully reloads after initial load
- Uses AJAX or WebSockets to communicate with the server
- Routes are handled on the client side

Popular frameworks for building SPAs include:
- React
- Angular
- Vue.js
- Ember.js

Benefits include faster user experiences (after initial load), reduced server load, and a more desktop-like experience. However, SPAs can have challenges with SEO, initial load time, and browser history management.

### 61. What is GraphQL?

**Answer:**
GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook in 2015. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, nothing more and nothing less.

Key features:
- **Declarative data fetching:** Clients specify exactly what data they need
- **Single endpoint:** One API endpoint handles all requests
- **Strong typing:** The schema defines what queries are possible
- **Hierarchical:** Queries mirror the shape of the data returned
- **Introspection:** The API can be queried for its own schema

Benefits:
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data
- Enables faster product development
- Powerful developer tools through the type system
- Versioning becomes easier (fields can be deprecated)
- Enables a strong decoupling of client and server

Example GraphQL query:
```graphql
{
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        body
      }
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL is increasingly popular for modern web and mobile applications, especially those with complex data requirements or multiple client platforms.

### 62. What is WebAssembly (WASM)?

**Answer:**
WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine that enables high-performance execution of code on web browsers. It's designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

Key features:
- **Fast:** Executes at near-native speed
- **Safe:** Runs in a sandboxed environment with the same security guarantees as JavaScript
- **Open:** Designed as an open standard by a W3C Community Group
- **Portable:** Doesn't depend on a specific hardware architecture
- **Compact:** Has a binary format that's efficient to transmit over the network

WebAssembly allows languages other than JavaScript (like C, C++, Rust) to run on the web, opening possibilities for:
- Computationally intensive applications (games, video editing, 3D rendering)
- Porting existing applications to the web
- Performance-critical portions of web applications
- Secure sandboxing of code

While not a replacement for JavaScript, WebAssembly complements it by providing capabilities that were previously difficult or impossible in browser environments.

### 63. What is a Design Pattern in software development?

**Answer:**
A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It's not a finished design that can be directly converted into code, but rather a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Common design patterns include:

1. **Creational Patterns:** Deal with object creation mechanisms
   - Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance
   - Factory Method: Creates objects without specifying the exact class
   - Builder: Separates object construction from its representation

2. **Structural Patterns:** Deal with object composition
   - Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
   - Decorator: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
   - Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem

3. **Behavioral Patterns:** Deal with object communication
   - Observer: Defines a dependency between objects
   - Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms
   - Command: Encapsulates a request as an object

Design patterns help developers solve common problems using proven solutions, improve code readability, and facilitate communication between developers by providing a common vocabulary.

### 64. What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

**Answer:**
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The key goals are to find and address bugs more quickly, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new updates.

Key principles:
- Maintain a single source repository
- Automate the build process
- Make the build self-testing
- Everyone commits to the main branch frequently
- Every commit should build the main branch on an integration machine
- Keep the build fast
- Test in a clone of the production environment
- Make it easy to get the latest deliverables
- Everyone can see the results of the latest build
- Automate deployment

Benefits:
- Early detection of integration issues
- Reduced integration problems
- Higher code quality
- Faster development cycles
- Immediate feedback to developers

CI is typically implemented using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD.

### 65. What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?

**Answer:**
Continuous Deployment is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production without manual intervention. Every change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to the production environment.

Key characteristics:
- Fully automated release process
- Deployment happens automatically after CI passes
- No human intervention required
- Relies heavily on robust automated testing
- Requires strong monitoring and rollback capabilities

Benefits:
- Faster time to market for new features
- More frequent releases
- Reduced risk through smaller, incremental changes
- Immediate feedback from users
- Elimination of manual deployment errors
- More stable production environment

Continuous Deployment is the most advanced form of automation in the deployment pipeline. It's different from Continuous Delivery, which ensures code is always in a deployable state but may involve a manual approval step before deployment to production.

### 66. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

**Answer:**
Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. It treats infrastructure configuration like software code.

Key principles:
- Infrastructure is defined in code files
- These files are version-controlled
- Infrastructure can be automatically deployed from these files
- Changes follow the same process as application code (review, testing, etc.)
- Idempotent operations (same result regardless of how many times executed)

Benefits:
- Consistency and standardization across environments
- Rapid provisioning and deployment
- Version control and history of infrastructure changes
- Reduced risk of human error
- Self-documenting infrastructure
- Easier disaster recovery
- Cost reduction through automation

Popular IaC tools include:
- Terraform
- AWS CloudFormation
- Azure Resource Manager templates
- Google Cloud Deployment Manager
- Ansible
- Puppet
- Chef

IaC is a fundamental practice in DevOps and cloud computing, enabling the "cattle, not pets" approach to infrastructure management.

### 67. What is a Webhook?

**Answer:**
A webhook is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. It delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately rather than having to poll for it.

How webhooks work:
1. A user configures a webhook URL in the sending application
2. When a specific event occurs in the sending application, it sends an HTTP request (usually POST) to that URL
3. The receiving application processes the data in the request

Think of webhooks as "reverse APIs" - instead of your application requesting data from another service, the service pushes data to your application when events happen.

Common uses:
- Payment processing notifications
- GitHub repository events (commits, pull requests)
- Form submissions
- CRM updates
- Chat application integrations
- IoT device events

Webhooks are more efficient than polling because they eliminate the need for constant API requests to check for updates, reducing unnecessary server load and providing real-time data delivery.

### 68. What is a Proxy Server?

**Answer:**
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client (like a web browser) and another server (like a website). When a client sends a request, it goes to the proxy server first, which then forwards the request to the destination server, receives the response, and delivers it back to the client.

Types of proxy servers:
- **Forward proxy:** Acts on behalf of clients (often used within organizations)
- **Reverse proxy:** Acts on behalf of servers (often used for load balancing, caching)
- **Transparent proxy:** Doesn't modify requests or responses
- **Anonymous proxy:** Modifies requests to hide identifying information

Common uses:
- Content filtering and web access control
- Bypassing browsing restrictions
- Privacy and security enhancement
- Caching frequently accessed resources
- Load balancing
- Logging and monitoring web traffic
- Accessing geo-restricted content

Proxy servers add an extra layer between clients and the servers they communicate with, which can provide benefits for security, performance, and access control.

### 69. What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?

**Answer:**
A Content Delivery Network is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.

How CDNs work:
1. Content is stored on origin servers
2. The CDN copies this content to multiple servers (edge servers) around the world
3. When a user requests content, it's delivered from the nearest edge server
4. If the content isn't cached on that server, it retrieves it from the origin server

Benefits:
- Faster content delivery (reduced latency)
- Reduced bandwidth costs
- Decreased server load
- Increased content availability and redundancy
- Protection against certain cyber attacks (e.g., DDoS)
- Global reach

CDNs are commonly used for:
- Static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript)
- Video streaming
- Software downloads
- Website acceleration
- Gaming file distribution

Popular CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, and Fastly.

### 70. What is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack?

**Answer:**
A Distributed Denial of Service attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic from multiple sources. Unlike a regular Denial of Service (DoS) attack that uses a single computer and internet connection, a DDoS attack uses many computers and connections, often distributed globally in a botnet.

Common types of DDoS attacks:
- **Volume-based attacks:** Overwhelm bandwidth (e.g., UDP floods)
- **Protocol attacks:** Target server resources (e.g., SYN floods)
- **Application layer attacks:** Target specific applications (e.g., HTTP floods)

Signs of a DDoS attack:
- Unusually slow network performance
- Unavailability of a website
- Inability to access any website
- Dramatic increase in spam emails

Protection methods:
- Traffic analysis and filtering
- Black hole routing
- Rate limiting
- Web application firewalls
- Anycast network diffusion
- CDN services with DDoS protection
- Cloud-based DDoS protection services

DDoS attacks can cause significant business disruption, financial losses, and reputational damage, making DDoS protection an important aspect of cybersecurity strategy.

### 71. What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

**Answer:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. When these scripts execute in a victim's browser, they can steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, or redirect users to malicious sites.

Types of XSS attacks:
- **Reflected XSS:** Malicious script comes from the current HTTP request
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is stored on the target server
- **DOM-based XSS:** Vulnerability exists in client-side code

Example scenario:
1. A website has a search function that displays your search term on the results page
2. An attacker crafts a URL with a script in the search parameter: `https://example.com/search?q=<script>malicious code</script>`
3. When a victim clicks this link, the script executes in their browser

Prevention methods:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Using modern frameworks that automatically escape output
- HTTP-only cookies
- Regular security testing

XSS remains one of the most common web application vulnerabilities and is listed in the OWASP Top 10 security risks.

### 72. What is SQL Injection?

**Answer:**
SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in applications that interact with databases. Attackers insert malicious SQL statements into entry fields, which are then executed by the application's database. This can allow attackers to access, modify, or delete data they shouldn't have access to.

Example scenario:
1. A login form expects a username and password
2. Normal query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='input_username' AND password='input_password'`
3. Attacker enters: `' OR '1'='1` as the username
4. Resulting query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR '1'='1' AND password='input_password'`
5. Since `'1'='1'` is always true, this returns all user records, potentially bypassing authentication

Common SQL Injection attacks:
- Authentication bypass
- Information extraction
- Data modification or deletion
- Command execution
- Privilege escalation

Prevention methods:
- Prepared statements with parameterized queries
- Stored procedures
- Input validation
- Escaping user inputs
- Principle of least privilege for database accounts
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

SQL Injection has been responsible for many high-profile data breaches and remains a critical security concern for applications that interact with databases.

### 73. What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?

**Answer:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery is a type of attack that tricks a user's browser into executing unwanted actions on a website where they're already authenticated. The attack works by including a link or script in a page that accesses a site to which the user is known to have authenticated.

Example scenario:
1. User logs into their bank account and receives a cookie
2. Without logging out, they visit a malicious website
3. The malicious site contains code that submits a form to the bank's transfer money function
4. Since the user's browser still has the authentication cookie, the bank's website processes the request as legitimate

CSRF attacks target state-changing requests (like fund transfers, password changes, or data modifications), not theft of data, since the attacker can't see the response to the forged request.

Prevention methods:
- CSRF tokens (unique, secret, unpredictable values for each request)
- Same-site cookies
- Custom request headers
- Checking the Referer header
- Requiring re-authentication for sensitive actions
- Using POST instead of GET for state-changing operations

CSRF vulnerabilities can be particularly dangerous because they leverage the victim's authenticated session to perform unauthorized actions.

### 74. What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

**Answer:**
Two-Factor Authentication is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

The three main types of authentication factors are:
1. **Something you know** (knowledge): Password, PIN, security question
2. **Something you have** (possession): Mobile phone, security token, smart card
3. **Something you are** (inherence): Fingerprint, facial recognition, voice recognition

Common 2FA implementations:
- SMS text message with a verification code
- Authentication apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Hardware tokens (YubiKey)
- Biometric verification
- Email verification codes
- Push notifications to mobile devices

Benefits:
- Significantly improved security over passwords alone
- Protection against phishing, social engineering, and password brute-force attacks
- Reduced risk of data breaches
- Compliance with security regulations in many industries

While not completely foolproof, 2FA dramatically increases security by requiring attackers to compromise multiple authentication methods rather than just a password.

### 75. What is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack?

**Answer:**
A Man-in-the-Middle attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication or even impersonate one of the parties.

How it works:
1. Two parties (A and B) attempt to communicate
2. Attacker intercepts the communication
3. Attacker establishes separate connections with both A and B
4. Messages pass through the attacker, who can read or modify them
5. Neither A nor B is aware of the attacker's presence

Common MitM attack scenarios:
- Public Wi-Fi interception
- ARP spoofing (on local networks)
- DNS spoofing
- HTTPS spoofing
- Email hijacking
- Session hijacking

Prevention methods:
- Using HTTPS (TLS/SSL encryption)
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- Public key infrastructure and certificate pinning
- Strong Wi-Fi encryption (WPA3)
- Multi-factor authentication
- DNS security extensions (DNSSEC)
- Mutual authentication

MitM attacks are particularly dangerous because they can bypass encryption if implemented at the connection establishment phase, making them difficult to detect.

### 76. What is a Zero-Day Vulnerability?

**Answer:**
A zero-day vulnerability is a software security flaw that is unknown to those who should be interested in mitigating it, including the vendor of the target software. The term "zero-day" refers to the fact that developers have had zero days to address and patch the vulnerability.

Key characteristics:
- Unknown to the software vendor
- No patch or fix is available
- Often discovered by attackers or security researchers
- Can be exploited before the vendor becomes aware
- Highly valuable in underground markets

The lifecycle of a zero-day vulnerability:
1. Discovery (by attackers or researchers)
2. Exploitation begins (if discovered by attackers)
3. Disclosure to vendor (if discovered by ethical researchers)
4. Development of a patch
5. Patch release
6. Patch deployment by users

Protection strategies:
- Defense in depth (multiple layers of security)
- Behavior-based security solutions
- Regular updates and patches for all software
- Principle of least privilege
- Network segmentation
- Intrusion detection/prevention systems

Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because traditional security measures like signature-based antivirus and known vulnerability scanners cannot detect them.

### 77. What is Penetration Testing?

**Answer:**
Penetration testing (also called pen testing or ethical hacking) is a security practice where a cybersecurity expert attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system. The purpose is to identify security weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious attackers.

Types of penetration tests:
- **Black box:** Tester has no prior knowledge of the system
- **White box:** Tester has complete knowledge of the system
- **Gray box:** Tester has partial knowledge of the system
- **External:** Testing from outside the organization's network
- **Internal:** Testing from within the organization's network
- **Social engineering:** Testing human-based vulnerabilities

Typical penetration testing process:
1. **Planning:** Define scope and goals
2. **Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the target
3. **Scanning:** Identify potential vulnerabilities
4. **Exploitation:** Attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities
5. **Post-exploitation:** Determine the value of the compromise
6. **Reporting:** Document findings and recommendations

Benefits:
- Identifies vulnerabilities before attackers do
- Tests existing security measures
- Helps meet compliance requirements
- Provides a real-world assessment of security posture
- Helps prioritize security investments

Penetration testing is an essential component of a comprehensive security program and should be conducted regularly, especially after significant system changes.

### 78. What is Encryption?

**Answer:**
Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It transforms readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using mathematical algorithms and a key. Only those with the correct key can decrypt the information back into its original form.

Types of encryption:
- **Symmetric encryption:** Uses the same key for encryption and decryption
  - Faster but requires secure key exchange
  - Examples: AES, DES, 3DES

- **Asymmetric encryption:** Uses a pair of keys (public and private)
  - Public key encrypts, private key decrypts
  - Slower but solves key distribution problem
  - Examples: RSA, ECC, DSA

- **End-to-end encryption:** Data is encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the recipient's device
  - No intermediaries can access the unencrypted data
  - Used in messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal

Common applications:
- Secure communications (HTTPS, VPNs)
- File and disk encryption
- Password storage (using one-way hashing)
- Digital signatures
- Secure messaging

Encryption strength depends on the algorithm used, key length, and proper implementation. It's a fundamental technology for data protection, privacy, and security in the digital world.

### 79. What is a Blockchain?

**Answer:**
A blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, and typically public digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. The key innovation is that the ledger can record transactions between parties efficiently, in a verifiable and permanent way without requiring a central authority.

Key characteristics:
- **Distributed:** Copies exist on multiple computers (nodes)
- **Decentralized:** No single entity controls the entire network
- **Immutable:** Once recorded, data cannot be altered retroactively
- **Transparent:** All transactions are visible to anyone on the network
- **Secure:** Uses cryptography to secure transactions

How it works:
1. Transactions are grouped into blocks
2. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block
3. Blocks are verified by network nodes through a consensus mechanism
4. Once verified, a block cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks

Common consensus mechanisms:
- Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin)
- Proof of Stake (used by Ethereum 2.0)
- Delegated Proof of Stake
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance

Applications beyond cryptocurrency:
- Supply chain tracking
- Digital identity verification
- Smart contracts
- Voting systems
- Healthcare record management
- Intellectual property protection

While blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its potential applications extend far beyond digital currencies.

### 80. What is a Smart Contract?

**Answer:**
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It automatically enforces and executes the terms when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

Key characteristics:
- **Self-executing:** Automatically performs when conditions are met
- **Immutable:** Once deployed, cannot be changed
- **Distributed:** Exists on a blockchain network
- **Transparent:** Visible to all participants
- **Trustless:** Doesn't require trust between parties or third-party enforcement

How smart contracts work:
1. Parties agree on contract terms
2. Terms are coded into a smart contract
3. Contract is deployed to a blockchain
4. When triggering conditions occur, the contract automatically executes
5. The blockchain records the execution

Common applications:
- Financial services (loans, insurance claims)
- Supply chain management
- Real estate transactions
- Voting systems
- Intellectual property and royalty distribution
- Decentralized applications (DApps)

Popular platforms for smart contracts:
- Ethereum (most widely used)
- Solana
- Cardano
- Polkadot
- Binance Smart Chain

Smart contracts reduce the need for trusted intermediaries, lower transaction costs, and can increase the speed and accuracy of various business processes.

### 81. What is the difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?

**Answer:**
Machine Learning and Deep Learning are both subfields of Artificial Intelligence, but they differ in their approach, complexity, and capabilities:

**Machine Learning:**
- Uses algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions
- Requires feature extraction by human experts
- Works well with structured data
- Needs less computational power and data
- Includes algorithms like:
  - Linear/Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines
  - K-Means Clustering

**Deep Learning:**
- A specialized subset of Machine Learning
- Uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep")
- Automatically discovers relevant features from data
- Excels with unstructured data (images, text, audio)
- Requires substantial computational resources and large datasets
- Includes architectures like:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  - Transformers
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

The key difference is that traditional machine learning requires manual feature engineering, while deep learning automatically extracts features from raw data through its multiple layers of neural networks, enabling it to handle more complex patterns and unstructured data.

### 82. What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

**Answer:**
Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

Key components of NLP:
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Comprehending the meaning of language
- **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Creating human-like text or speech
- **Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language to text
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Identifying emotions and opinions in text
- **Named Entity Recognition:** Identifying entities like people, places, organizations
- **Machine Translation:** Translating between languages

Common NLP applications:
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Text summarization
- Content categorization
- Machine translation services
- Sentiment analysis for social media monitoring
- Spam detection
- Autocomplete and predictive text
- Voice-operated GPS systems
- Healthcare documentation

NLP has advanced significantly with the development of transformer models like BERT and GPT, enabling more sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities.

### 83. What is the Internet Protocol (IP)?

**Answer:**
The Internet Protocol is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying packets of data across network boundaries. It's the primary protocol that establishes the rules for how data should be sent from one computer to another over the internet.

Key aspects of IP:
- **Addressing:** Assigns a unique IP address to each device on a network
- **Routing:** Determines the path that data packets should take
- **Fragmentation:** Breaks large data packets into smaller ones when necessary
- **Reassembly:** Puts fragmented packets back together at the destination
- **Connectionless:** Doesn't establish a connection before sending data

There are two main versions:
- **IPv4:** Uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), allowing for about 4.3 billion unique addresses
- **IPv6:** Uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334), allowing for an astronomically larger number of addresses

IP works in conjunction with other protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to provide reliable data transmission across the internet. While IP handles the addressing and routing of packets, TCP ensures they arrive correctly and in order.

### 84. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

**Answer:**
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two transport layer protocols used for sending data packets over the internet. They differ in how they handle data transmission:

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
- **Connection-oriented:** Establishes a connection before data transfer
- **Reliable:** Guarantees delivery of data packets
- **Ordered:** Delivers packets in the same order they were sent
- **Error-checking:** Verifies data integrity and requests retransmission if needed
- **Flow control:** Manages data transmission rate to prevent overwhelming the receiver
- **Slower:** Due to its overhead for reliability features
- **Use cases:** Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfers (FTP), situations where data accuracy is critical

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
- **Connectionless:** No connection establishment before sending data
- **Unreliable:** No guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection
- **No error recovery:** Doesn't request retransmission of lost packets
- **Lightweight:** Minimal protocol overhead
- **Faster:** Due to lack of error-checking and connection management
- **Use cases:** Video streaming, online gaming, VoIP, DNS lookups, situations where speed is more important than perfect reliability

The choice between TCP and UDP depends on the application's requirements. TCP is like a certified mail service that ensures delivery but takes more time, while UDP is like regular mail that's faster but might not always arrive.

### 85. What is an API Gateway?

**Answer:**
An API Gateway is a server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then passing the response back to the requester. It's a single entry point for all clients, even though the actual API might be composed of many microservices.

Key functions:
- **Request routing:** Directs requests to the appropriate backend services
- **Authentication and authorization:** Verifies user identity and permissions
- **Rate limiting and throttling:** Prevents API abuse and ensures fair usage
- **Caching:** Stores frequently accessed data to reduce backend load
- **Request/response transformation:** Modifies data formats between client and server
- **Monitoring and analytics:** Tracks API usage and performance
- **Load balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple backend instances
- **Circuit breaking:** Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems

Benefits:
- Simplifies client interactions with complex backend architectures
- Provides a unified interface for different clients (web, mobile, IoT)
- Improves security by centralizing authentication and authorization
- Enables better monitoring and management of API traffic
- Facilitates API versioning and lifecycle management

Popular API Gateway solutions include Amazon API Gateway, Kong, Apigee, and Azure API Management.

### 86. What is Serverless Computing?

**Answer:**
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered and fully managed by the cloud provider.

Key characteristics:
- **No server management:** Developers don't need to provision or maintain servers
- **Pay-per-use:** Billing is based on actual compute time used, not pre-purchased capacity
- **Auto-scaling:** Automatically scales with usage
- **Event-driven:** Functions are triggered by specific events
- **Stateless:** Each function execution is independent
- **Short-lived:** Functions typically run for brief periods

Benefits:
- Reduced operational costs (no idle capacity)
- Simplified deployment and operations
- Automatic scaling
- Faster time to market
- Focus on code rather than infrastructure
- Built-in high availability and fault tolerance

Common serverless platforms:
- AWS Lambda
- Azure Functions
- Google Cloud Functions
- IBM Cloud Functions
- Cloudflare Workers

Serverless is ideal for workloads with variable or unpredictable traffic, microservices, real-time file processing, scheduled tasks, and backend APIs. However, it may not be suitable for long-running processes, applications with specific performance requirements, or systems requiring complex state management.

### 87. What is Edge Computing?

**Answer:**
Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. This is done to improve response times, save bandwidth, and enable enhanced real-time capabilities.

Key characteristics:
- **Proximity:** Processing occurs near the data source rather than in a centralized cloud
- **Reduced latency:** Faster response times due to shorter data travel distances
- **Bandwidth efficiency:** Less data needs to be sent to the cloud
- **Distributed architecture:** Computing power spread across many locations
- **Local data processing:** Data can be processed without sending it to the cloud

Use cases:
- IoT device networks
- Autonomous vehicles
- Smart cities and buildings
- Industrial automation
- Content delivery networks
- Augmented and virtual reality
- Remote monitoring in healthcare
- Real-time analytics in retail

Edge computing complements cloud computing rather than replacing it. The edge handles time-sensitive processing and local data storage, while the cloud provides more powerful computing for complex analytics, long-term storage, and coordination across edge devices.

### 88. What is a Service Mesh?

**Answer:**
A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communications between microservices, often using a sidecar proxy. It provides capabilities like service discovery, load balancing, encryption, authentication and authorization, circuit breaking, and observability.

Key components:
- **Data plane:** Consists of proxies (sidecars) deployed alongside each service instance
- **Control plane:** Manages and configures the proxies to route traffic and enforce policies

Core features:
- **Traffic management:** Routing, load balancing, failover
- **Security:** Encryption (TLS), authentication, authorization
- **Observability:** Metrics, logs, traces
- **Reliability:** Circuit breaking, retries, timeouts, fault injection

Benefits:
- Decouples communication logic from application code
- Provides consistent networking features across services
- Improves visibility into service communication
- Enhances security with encryption and access controls
- Increases reliability with circuit breaking and retries
- Simplifies complex operational tasks

Popular service mesh implementations:
- Istio
- Linkerd
- Consul Connect
- AWS App Mesh
- Kuma

Service meshes are particularly valuable in large, complex microservices architectures where managing service-to-service communication becomes challenging.

### 89. What is a Monolithic Architecture?

**Answer:**
A monolithic architecture is a traditional software development approach where an application is built as a single, indivisible unit. All components of the application are interconnected and interdependent, running as a single service.

Key characteristics:
- **Single codebase:** All functionality exists in one codebase
- **Single deployment unit:** The entire application is deployed at once
- **Shared database:** All components typically use the same database
- **Tightly coupled:** Components are interdependent
- **Single technology stack:** Usually built with one programming language and framework

Advantages:
- Simpler development for smaller applications
- Easier testing (everything is in one place)
- Faster performance for certain operations (no network calls between components)
- Simpler deployment process
- Less operational complexity

Disadvantages:
- Harder to understand as the application grows
- More difficult to scale specific components
- Technology stack is fixed for the entire application
- Longer build and deployment times
- Higher risk when deploying changes
- Team coordination challenges in larger projects

Monolithic architecture contrasts with microservices architecture, where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Many organizations start with a monolith for simplicity and may later transition to microservices as the application grows and scaling becomes more important.

### 90. What is a Headless CMS?

**Answer:**
A headless CMS (Content Management System) is a back-end only content management system that acts as a content repository, making content accessible via an API for display on any device or platform. Unlike traditional CMS systems, a headless CMS doesn't have a built-in front-end or presentation layer.

Key characteristics:
- **API-first:** Content is delivered via APIs (typically RESTful or GraphQL)
- **Front-end agnostic:** No predefined front-end, works with any technology
- **Content-focused:** Manages content without concern for how it's presented
- **Omnichannel ready:** Content can be used across websites, mobile apps, IoT devices, etc.

Benefits:
- **Flexibility:** Developers can use any front-end technology
- **Future-proof:** Content can be repurposed for new channels and devices
- **Improved performance:** Front-end can be optimized independently
- **Better developer experience:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalability:** Content delivery can be optimized separately from content management

Use cases:
- Multi-channel publishing (web, mobile, IoT, digital signage)
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- E-commerce platforms requiring content across multiple touchpoints
- Organizations with complex content requirements

Popular headless CMS platforms include Contentful, Strapi, Sanity.io, Prismic, and headless versions of traditional CMS like WordPress with REST API.

### 91. What is a Static Site Generator?

**Answer:**
A Static Site Generator (SSG) is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and templates. Unlike traditional dynamic websites that generate content on-demand for each request, static sites are pre-built and served as-is to users.

How it works:
1. Content is stored in markdown files, databases, APIs, or CMS
2. Templates define the site structure and layout
3. The SSG combines content with templates at build time
4. The result is a set of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
5. These files are deployed to a web server or CDN

Benefits:
- **Performance:** Faster load times as pages are pre-rendered
- **Security:** Reduced attack surface with no server-side processing
- **Scalability:** Easily handles traffic spikes
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Cheaper hosting (no server-side processing)
- **Version control:** Content can be managed in Git
- **Developer experience:** Uses modern tools and workflows

Popular Static Site Generators:
- Gatsby (React-based)
- Next.js (React-based, also supports SSR)
- Hugo (Go-based, known for speed)
- Jekyll (Ruby-based)
- Eleventy (JavaScript-based)
- Nuxt.js (Vue-based)

Static sites are ideal for blogs, documentation, marketing sites, and other content-focused websites where content doesn't change frequently based on user interaction or real-time data.

### 92. What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

**Answer:**
Server-Side Rendering is a technique where a web page is rendered on the server and sent to the client as a fully rendered HTML page. The browser can display the HTML immediately while JavaScript is still being loaded and executed.

How it works:
1. User requests a page
2. Server runs the application code to generate HTML
3. Server sends complete HTML to the browser
4. Browser displays the HTML immediately
5. Browser downloads JavaScript
6. JavaScript takes over for interactivity (hydration)

Benefits:
- **Improved initial load time:** Users see content faster
- **Better SEO:** Search engines can easily index the content
- **Enhanced performance on low-powered devices:** Less client-side processing required
- **Better social media sharing:** Preview images and metadata are available in the initial HTML
- **Improved accessibility:** Content is available even if JavaScript fails

Challenges:
- **Server load:** Requires more server resources
- **Complexity:** More complex setup and deployment
- **TTFB (Time To First Byte):** Can be slower due to server processing time
- **Caching challenges:** Dynamic content is harder to cache

Popular frameworks for SSR:
- Next.js (React)
- Nuxt.js (Vue)
- Angular Universal
- SvelteKit

Server-Side Rendering is often contrasted with Client-Side Rendering (where rendering happens in the browser) and Static Site Generation (where pages are pre-rendered at build time).

### 93. What is Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?

**Answer:**
Client-Side Rendering is a web application rendering strategy where the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and JavaScript, then JavaScript runs in the browser to render the content. The initial HTML typically contains little more than links to CSS and JavaScript files.

How it works:
1. User requests a page
2. Server sends minimal HTML with JavaScript links
3. Browser downloads JavaScript
4. JavaScript executes and requests data from APIs
5. JavaScript renders the page content in the browser

Benefits:
- **Rich interactions:** Smooth transitions and dynamic content
- **Reduced server load:** Server only delivers static files and API data
- **Faster subsequent page loads:** Only new data needs to be fetched
- **Clear separation of concerns:** Backend provides data, frontend handles presentation
- **Offline capabilities:** Can work without constant server connection

Challenges:
- **Slower initial load:** Users wait for JavaScript to download and execute
- **SEO challenges:** Search engines may not execute JavaScript (though this is improving)
- **Performance on low-end devices:** Requires more client-side processing power
- **Accessibility concerns:** Content may not be available until JavaScript loads

Popular frameworks for CSR:
- React
- Vue.js
- Angular
- Svelte

Client-Side Rendering is often used for web applications with rich user interactions, dashboards, and admin interfaces where SEO is less critical and users benefit from a more app-like experience.

### 94. What is Jamstack?

**Answer:**
Jamstack is a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup. The term "JAM" stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It decouples the frontend from the backend, allowing for more secure, faster, and easier-to-scale websites.

Key principles:
- **Pre-rendered content:** Pages are generated at build time, not on-demand
- **Decoupling:** Clear separation between frontend and backend services
- **Client-side functionality:** Enhanced with JavaScript after initial load
- **Modern build tools:** Leverages build processes and automation
- **Atomic deployments:** Entire site is deployed at once, ensuring consistency
- **CDN distribution:** Content is served from a CDN for performance

Benefits:
- **Performance:** Fast loading due to pre-built files served from a CDN
- **Security:** Reduced attack surface with no server-side processes
- **Scalability:** Static files are easy to distribute globally
- **Developer experience:** Modern workflows and tooling
- **Maintainability:** Separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Lower hosting costs for static assets

Common technologies in Jamstack:
- **Static Site Generators:** Gatsby, Next.js, Hugo, Eleventy
- **Headless CMS:** Contentful, Sanity.io, Strapi
- **Deployment platforms:** Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
- **APIs:** REST, GraphQL, serverless functions

Jamstack is particularly well-suited for content-focused websites, blogs, e-commerce sites, and marketing sites where performance and security are priorities.

### 95. What is the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming?

**Answer:**
Synchronous and asynchronous programming represent two different approaches to executing operations, particularly important in contexts like web development and user interfaces.

**Synchronous Programming:**
- Operations are executed sequentially, one after another
- Each operation must complete before the next one begins
- Blocks execution until the current operation finishes
- Simpler to understand and debug
- Can lead to unresponsive applications if operations take a long time

Example (JavaScript):
```javascript
const result = database.query("SELECT * FROM users"); // Blocks until complete
console.log(result); // Runs after query completes
processNextTask(); // Waits for everything above
```

**Asynchronous Programming:**
- Operations can be executed in parallel
- Code continues running without waiting for long-running operations to complete
- Uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle operation completion
- More complex to understand and debug
- Prevents blocking the main thread, keeping applications responsive

Example (JavaScript):
```javascript
database.query("SELECT * FROM users").then(result => {
  console.log(result); // Runs when query completes
});
processNextTask(); // Runs immediately, doesn't wait for query
```

Asynchronous programming is essential for:
- User interfaces (to remain responsive)
- Network requests (to avoid blocking while waiting)
- File operations (to handle slow I/O efficiently)
- Any operation that might take a significant amount of time

Most modern programming environments provide mechanisms for asynchronous programming, such as promises in JavaScript, async/await in many languages, or dedicated concurrency models like Go's goroutines.

### 96. What is a Web Socket?

**Answer:**
WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection between a client and server. Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based, WebSockets allow for real-time, bidirectional communication.

Key characteristics:
- **Persistent connection:** Stays open until explicitly closed by either party
- **Bidirectional:** Both client and server can send messages at any time
- **Low latency:** Minimal overhead after initial handshake
- **Real-time:** Enables immediate data transfer in both directions
- **Efficient:** Reduces network traffic compared to polling

How WebSockets work:
1. Client initiates a WebSocket connection through a process called a handshake
2. The handshake starts as an HTTP request with an Upgrade header
3. Server responds, agreeing to the protocol switch
4. The connection is upgraded from HTTP to WebSocket
5. Both parties can now send messages independently

Common use cases:
- Chat applications
- Live sports updates
- Collaborative editing tools
- Real-time dashboards
- Online gaming
- Financial trading platforms
- IoT device communication
- Notifications and alerts

WebSockets are supported in all modern browsers and have libraries available in most programming languages. They're particularly valuable when applications require low-latency, real-time updates in both directions.

### 97. What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

**Answer:**
Progressive Web Apps are web applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. They combine the best features of the web and mobile applications.

Key characteristics:
- **Progressive:** Work for every user, regardless of browser choice
- **Responsive:** Fit any form factor (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- **Connectivity independent:** Function offline or with poor network conditions
- **App-like:** Feel like an app with app-style interactions and navigation
- **Fresh:** Always up-to-date due to the service worker update process
- **Safe:** Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping
- **Discoverable:** Identifiable as "applications" by search engines
- **Re-engageable:** Can send push notifications
- **Installable:** Can be added to the home screen without an app store
- **Linkable:** Can be shared via URL

Core technologies:
- **Service Workers:** Enable offline functionality and background features
- **Web App Manifest:** Provides metadata for installation
- **HTTPS:** Required for security and service worker functionality
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures usability across devices

Benefits:
- Lower development costs compared to native apps
- No app store approval process
- Instant updates without user action
- Better performance than traditional web apps
- Improved user engagement through push notifications
- Reduced friction (no download required to start using)

PWAs bridge the gap between web pages and mobile applications, offering many native app features while maintaining the accessibility and reach of the web.

### 98. What is a RESTful API?

**Answer:**
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, almost always HTTP, and treats server objects as resources that can be created, read, updated, or deleted.

Key principles:
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Separation of concerns between client and server
- **Statelessness:** No client context stored on the server between requests
- **Cacheability:** Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable
- **Layered System:** Client cannot tell if it's connected directly to the end server
- **Uniform Interface:** Standardized way to interact with resources

RESTful APIs typically use:
- **HTTP Methods:**
  - GET: Retrieve a resource
  - POST: Create a new resource
  - PUT: Update an existing resource
  - DELETE: Remove a resource
  - PATCH: Partially update a resource

- **HTTP Status Codes:**
  - 200 OK: Successful request
  - 201 Created: Resource successfully created
  - 400 Bad Request: Invalid request
  - 404 Not Found: Resource not found
  - 500 Internal Server Error: Server-side error

Benefits:
- Simplicity and standardization
- Scalability due to statelessness
- Independence between client and server
- Wide adoption and understanding
- Compatibility with HTTP caching

RESTful APIs have become the standard for web services due to their simplicity, scalability, and alignment with the web's underlying HTTP protocol.

### 99. What is Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment?

**Answer:**
Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment are related but distinct DevOps practices that extend Continuous Integration. They differ primarily in how and when code changes are released to production.

**Continuous Delivery (CD):**
- Automatically builds, tests, and prepares code changes for release
- Ensures code is always in a deployable state
- Requires a manual approval step before deployment to production
- Gives business control over when features are released
- Allows for additional testing or verification before release

Process flow:
Code changes → Build → Automated tests → Staging environment → Manual approval → Production

**Continuous Deployment (CD):**
- Extends Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying all code changes to production
- No manual intervention required
- Every change that passes automated tests is released to users
- Provides faster feedback from users
- Requires very robust testing and monitoring

Process flow:
Code changes → Build → Automated tests → Automatic deployment to production

Key differences:
- **Manual approval:** Required in Continuous Delivery, absent in Continuous Deployment
- **Release frequency:** Continuous Deployment typically results in more frequent releases
- **Risk tolerance:** Continuous Deployment requires higher confidence in automated testing
- **Business control:** Continuous Delivery offers more control over release timing

Both practices share the goal of making software delivery more efficient and reliable, but they represent different levels of automation and risk tolerance.

### 100. What is the difference between Frontend, Backend, and Full Stack Development?

**Answer:**
Frontend, Backend, and Full Stack Development represent different specializations within web and application development, each focusing on different aspects of creating software.

**Frontend Development:**
- Focuses on what users see and interact with
- Creates the user interface and user experience
- Implements visual elements, layouts, and interactions
- Works primarily in the browser or client-side environment
- Key technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js
- Skills: UI/UX principles, responsive design, browser compatibility, accessibility

**Backend Development:**
- Focuses on server-side logic and database interactions
- Creates APIs, services, and data processing systems
- Handles authentication, authorization, and business logic
- Works with servers, databases, and application infrastructure
- Key technologies: Languages like Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js; databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Skills: Database design, API development, security, performance optimization

**Full Stack Development:**
- Combines both frontend and backend development skills
- Works across all layers of the application
- Can develop end-to-end features independently
- Understands how all parts of the application interact
- Key technologies: All of the above, plus deployment and DevOps tools
- Skills: Broader but sometimes less specialized knowledge of both frontend and backend

The boundaries between these roles can be fluid, especially in smaller teams where developers often wear multiple hats. Each specialization has its own career path and skill progression, though many developers start in one area and gradually expand their skills.
