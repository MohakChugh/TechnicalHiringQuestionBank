# Business Analyst Interview Questions and Answers - Part 1

## Requirements Engineering

### 1. What is requirements engineering?
**Answer:** Requirements engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to eliciting, documenting, analyzing, validating, and managing requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. It's a critical process that ensures the final product meets stakeholder needs and expectations.

Requirements engineering consists of several key activities:
- **Requirements elicitation**: Gathering requirements from stakeholders through various techniques
- **Requirements analysis**: Examining, refining, and organizing the collected requirements
- **Requirements specification**: Documenting the requirements in a clear, precise manner
- **Requirements validation**: Ensuring the requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs
- **Requirements management**: Tracking and controlling changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle

Effective requirements engineering is crucial because:
- It establishes a clear understanding of what needs to be built
- It reduces the risk of project failure or costly rework
- It provides a foundation for project planning, estimation, and scheduling
- It serves as a basis for system design, development, testing, and acceptance
- It helps manage stakeholder expectations and facilitates communication

### 2. What are the key activities in requirements engineering?
**Answer:** Requirements engineering comprises five core activities that form a continuous and iterative process:

1. **Requirements Elicitation**:
   - Identifying and collecting requirements from stakeholders
   - Using techniques like interviews, workshops, surveys, observation, and document analysis
   - Understanding the business domain, processes, and stakeholder needs
   - Discovering both explicit and implicit requirements

2. **Requirements Analysis**:
   - Examining and refining the gathered requirements
   - Identifying conflicts, ambiguities, and dependencies
   - Prioritizing requirements based on importance and feasibility
   - Negotiating trade-offs among stakeholders
   - Creating models to better understand the requirements

3. **Requirements Specification**:
   - Documenting requirements in a clear, precise, and verifiable manner
   - Creating formal specifications using appropriate templates and standards
   - Developing visual models to complement textual descriptions
   - Ensuring requirements are traceable, testable, and measurable

4. **Requirements Validation**:
   - Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness
   - Verifying that requirements are feasible, consistent, and unambiguous
   - Conducting formal inspections or walkthroughs
   - Creating prototypes to validate requirements
   - Developing test cases based on requirements

5. **Requirements Management**:
   - Establishing a baseline for approved requirements
   - Tracking and controlling changes to requirements
   - Maintaining traceability between requirements and other project artifacts
   - Managing requirement versions and configurations
   - Communicating requirement changes to relevant stakeholders

These activities are not strictly sequential but often overlap and iterate throughout the project lifecycle. Effective requirements engineering requires continuous stakeholder engagement and adaptation as new information emerges.

### 3. What is the difference between business requirements, user requirements, and system requirements?
**Answer:** Requirements can be categorized into different levels based on their scope and perspective:

**Business Requirements:**
- Define the high-level needs of the organization or business as a whole
- Focus on the "why" - the business objectives, goals, and outcomes
- Are typically expressed in terms of business benefits, strategic goals, or market opportunities
- Are usually documented in a Business Case or Vision document
- Example: "The organization needs to reduce customer service response time by 30% to improve customer satisfaction."

**User Requirements:**
- Define what the users need to accomplish with the system
- Focus on the "what" - the tasks and activities users need to perform
- Are typically expressed from the user's perspective, often as use cases or user stories
- Are usually documented in a User Requirements Document or as user stories in an agile environment
- Example: "As a customer service representative, I need to access customer history while on a call so that I can provide personalized service."

**System Requirements:**
- Define the detailed functional and non-functional characteristics of the system
- Focus on the "how" - the specific features and capabilities the system must provide
- Are typically expressed in technical terms that guide development and testing
- Are further divided into:
  - **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do (features, capabilities)
  - **Non-functional Requirements**: Quality attributes like performance, security, usability, reliability
- Are usually documented in a System Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Example: "The system shall retrieve customer records within 2 seconds of entering the customer ID."

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Business Requirements | User Requirements | System Requirements |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Focus | Business objectives | User needs and tasks | System features and attributes |
| Perspective | Organization | End users | Developers and testers |
| Level of detail | High-level | Medium-level | Detailed |
| Expressed as | Goals and outcomes | Tasks and activities | Functions and constraints |
| Answers | Why is the system needed? | What will users do with the system? | How will the system work? |

Understanding these different levels of requirements helps ensure that the solution not only meets technical specifications but also delivers value to users and achieves business objectives.

### 4. What is the difference between functional and non-functional requirements?
**Answer:** Functional and non-functional requirements represent two fundamental categories of system requirements, each addressing different aspects of a system:

**Functional Requirements:**
- Define what the system should do - specific behaviors, features, and functions
- Describe the system's capabilities, interactions, and responses to inputs
- Focus on the system's functionality from a user's perspective
- Are typically expressed as "The system shall..." statements
- Can be directly tested through specific test cases with clear pass/fail criteria
- Examples:
  - "The system shall allow users to reset their password via email verification."
  - "The system shall calculate tax based on the customer's location."
  - "The system shall send email notifications when inventory falls below threshold."
  - "The system shall allow administrators to create, update, and delete user accounts."

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Define how the system should perform its functions - quality attributes and constraints
- Describe the system's qualities, characteristics, and operational constraints
- Focus on performance, reliability, security, usability, and other quality aspects
- Are often expressed as measurable criteria or constraints
- May be more challenging to test and often require specialized testing approaches
- Examples:
  - **Performance**: "The system shall respond to search queries within 2 seconds under normal load."
  - **Security**: "All passwords must be stored using bcrypt hashing algorithm."
  - **Usability**: "90% of new users should be able to complete the checkout process without assistance."
  - **Reliability**: "The system must maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours."
  - **Scalability**: "The application must support up to 10,000 concurrent users."
  - **Compatibility**: "The website must function correctly on the last two versions of major browsers."

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Functional Requirements | Non-Functional Requirements |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Focus | What the system does | How the system performs |
| Nature | Features and capabilities | Quality attributes and constraints |
| User Perspective | Directly visible to users | Often "behind the scenes" but affect user experience |
| Testability | Typically binary (works/doesn't work) | Often measured on a scale or against benchmarks |
| Scope | Specific functions or features | System-wide characteristics |
| Negotiability | Can often be prioritized individually | Often apply to the entire system |
| Timing | Can be implemented incrementally | Often need to be designed in from the beginning |

Both types of requirements are essential for project success. Functional requirements deliver business value, while non-functional requirements ensure usability, reliability, and performance. Neglecting non-functional requirements often leads to technical debt and user dissatisfaction, even if all functional requirements are met.

### 5. What are the characteristics of good requirements?
**Answer:** Good requirements exhibit several key characteristics that make them effective for guiding development and ensuring project success. These characteristics are often remembered using the acronym "SMART" or the more comprehensive "INVEST" for user stories. The essential characteristics include:

**1. Clear and Unambiguous**
- Written in simple, concise language
- Free from jargon or technical terms (unless necessary and defined)
- Has only one possible interpretation
- Avoids vague terms like "user-friendly," "fast," or "efficient" without specific metrics

**2. Complete**
- Contains all necessary information
- Includes all scenarios, conditions, and exceptions
- Defines all inputs, outputs, and responses
- Specifies what happens in both normal and exceptional cases

**3. Correct**
- Accurately represents stakeholder needs
- Aligns with business objectives
- Free from factual errors
- Validated by relevant stakeholders

**4. Feasible**
- Technically possible to implement
- Achievable within project constraints (time, budget, resources)
- Realistic given the available technology and team skills

**5. Necessary**
- Directly linked to business needs or user requirements
- Adds value to the system
- Absence would result in a deficiency in the system

**6. Prioritized**
- Ranked by importance, urgency, or business value
- Helps in planning and decision-making when trade-offs are needed

**7. Verifiable/Testable**
- Can be confirmed through inspection, demonstration, or testing
- Has clear acceptance criteria
- Contains measurable terms rather than subjective qualities

**8. Traceable**
- Can be traced back to its source (business need, stakeholder request)
- Can be traced forward to design, code, and test cases
- Uniquely identified for reference

**9. Consistent**
- Does not contradict other requirements
- Uses consistent terminology throughout
- Aligns with existing systems and processes

**10. Atomic**
- Represents a single requirement that cannot be further subdivided
- Focuses on one specific capability or constraint

For user stories in Agile methodologies, the INVEST criteria is often used:
- **Independent**: Can be developed and delivered separately
- **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Delivers value to users or stakeholders
- **Estimable**: Can be sized or estimated
- **Small**: Small enough to be completed in a single iteration
- **Testable**: Has clear acceptance criteria

Well-written requirements that exhibit these characteristics reduce ambiguity, minimize rework, facilitate accurate estimation, and ultimately lead to higher quality solutions that meet stakeholder expectations.

### 6. What is the SMART criteria for requirements?
**Answer:** The SMART criteria is a framework used to ensure requirements are well-defined and effective. Originally developed for goal setting in management, it has been adapted for requirements engineering to create clear, actionable requirements. SMART is an acronym where each letter represents a key characteristic:

**S - Specific**
- Requirements should be precise and unambiguous
- They should clearly state what needs to be accomplished
- They should answer the questions: What, Why, Who, Where, and When
- Example of non-specific: "The system should be user-friendly"
- Example of specific: "The system shall allow users to complete the checkout process in 5 steps or fewer"

**M - Measurable**
- Requirements should include criteria for measuring success
- They should define how to determine if the requirement has been met
- They should contain quantifiable metrics whenever possible
- Example of non-measurable: "The system should load quickly"
- Example of measurable: "The system shall load the dashboard page within 3 seconds under normal network conditions"

**A - Achievable/Attainable**
- Requirements should be realistic and possible to implement
- They should be technically feasible within the project constraints
- They should consider available resources, technology, and team capabilities
- Example of unachievable: "The system shall be 100% error-free under all conditions"
- Example of achievable: "The system shall maintain an error rate below 0.1% for critical transactions"

**R - Relevant**
- Requirements should align with business objectives and user needs
- They should contribute to the overall goals of the project
- They should be worth implementing and provide value
- Example of irrelevant: "The system shall use the latest JavaScript framework" (without justification)
- Example of relevant: "The system shall integrate with the existing CRM to provide a unified customer view"

**T - Time-bound/Testable**
- Requirements should have a defined timeframe for implementation
- They should be verifiable through testing or other validation methods
- They should include clear acceptance criteria
- Example of non-testable: "The system shall be secure"
- Example of testable: "The system shall enforce password changes every 90 days and prevent reuse of the previous 5 passwords"

**Benefits of using SMART criteria:**
- Reduces ambiguity and misinterpretation
- Facilitates accurate estimation and planning
- Provides clear direction for development teams
- Enables objective verification and validation
- Improves communication between stakeholders and development teams
- Increases the likelihood of project success

When writing requirements, reviewing them against the SMART criteria helps ensure they provide a solid foundation for development, testing, and ultimately delivering a solution that meets stakeholder expectations.

### 7. What is requirements elicitation?
**Answer:** Requirements elicitation is the process of discovering, gathering, and extracting requirements from stakeholders and other sources to understand what a system should do to meet user needs and business objectives. It's the first and one of the most critical activities in the requirements engineering process.

**Key Aspects of Requirements Elicitation:**

1. **Purpose and Importance**:
   - Identifies stakeholder needs, expectations, and constraints
   - Uncovers both explicit and implicit requirements
   - Establishes a foundation for the entire project
   - Reduces the risk of building the wrong solution
   - Helps manage stakeholder expectations from the beginning

2. **Challenges**:
   - Stakeholders may not know what they want or need
   - Different stakeholders may have conflicting requirements
   - Domain knowledge may be tacit rather than explicit
   - Communication barriers between technical and non-technical stakeholders
   - Requirements may evolve or change during the elicitation process
   - Organizational politics and hidden agendas

3. **Common Techniques**:

   a. **Interviews**:
      - One-on-one or group discussions with stakeholders
      - Can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured
      - Effective for in-depth exploration of requirements
      - Example questions: "What are your main pain points with the current system?" or "Walk me through your typical workflow."

   b. **Workshops/JAD Sessions**:
      - Facilitated group sessions with multiple stakeholders
      - Promotes collaboration and consensus-building
      - Resolves conflicts and contradictions in real-time
      - Example activity: Collaborative process mapping or prioritization exercises

   c. **Surveys/Questionnaires**:
      - Written sets of questions distributed to a larger audience
      - Useful for gathering quantitative data and preferences
      - Reaches geographically dispersed stakeholders
      - Example: Rating features on a scale of importance from 1-5

   d. **Observation**:
      - Watching users perform their tasks in their natural environment
      - Uncovers tacit knowledge and actual (vs. reported) behavior
      - Identifies inefficiencies and improvement opportunities
      - Example: Shadowing a customer service representative handling calls

   e. **Document Analysis**:
      - Reviewing existing documentation, reports, and artifacts
      - Provides context and background information
      - Identifies constraints and integration points
      - Example documents: Process manuals, legacy system documentation, regulatory guidelines

   f. **Prototyping**:
      - Creating models or mockups of the proposed system
      - Helps stakeholders visualize and refine requirements
      - Validates understanding and gathers feedback
      - Example: Interactive wireframes or clickable prototypes

   g. **Use Cases/User Stories**:
      - Structured narratives describing user interactions with the system
      - Focuses on user goals and system responses
      - Provides context for requirements
      - Example: "As a customer, I want to track my order status so that I know when to expect delivery."

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Involve diverse stakeholders to get multiple perspectives
   - Use multiple elicitation techniques to gather comprehensive requirements
   - Document assumptions and constraints alongside requirements
   - Validate elicited requirements with stakeholders
   - Maintain traceability to requirement sources
   - Be aware of biases and leading questions
   - Focus on needs rather than solutions during initial elicitation

Requirements elicitation is not a one-time activity but an iterative process that continues throughout the project lifecycle as understanding evolves and requirements are refined.

### 8. What is requirements analysis?
**Answer:** Requirements analysis is the process of studying, refining, and organizing the requirements gathered during elicitation to ensure they are complete, consistent, unambiguous, and aligned with business objectives.
