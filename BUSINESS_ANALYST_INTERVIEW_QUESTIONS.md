- **Nature:** Describe specific functionality that helps users accomplish their tasks
- **Verification:** Can be verified through direct testing (the feature either works or doesn't)
- **Documentation:** Often captured as user stories, use cases, or feature descriptions

**Examples of Functional Requirements:**
- The system shall allow users to reset their password via email verification
- The application must enable users to search for products by name, category, or price
- The system shall automatically calculate tax based on the customer's location
- Users must be able to generate monthly sales reports by region
- The system shall send email notifications when inventory falls below threshold

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Definition:** Specify how the system should perform its functions; the quality attributes and constraints of the system
- **Focus:** Quality attributes, constraints, and performance characteristics
- **Nature:** Describe qualities that affect user satisfaction and system effectiveness
- **Verification:** Often measured on a scale rather than binary pass/fail
- **Documentation:** Often captured as quality attributes, constraints, or system qualities

**Examples of Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **Performance:** The system must respond to search queries within 2 seconds under normal load
- **Security:** All passwords must be stored using bcrypt hashing algorithm
- **Usability:** 90% of new users should be able to complete the checkout process without assistance
- **Reliability:** The system must maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours
- **Scalability:** The application must support up to 10,000 concurrent users
- **Compatibility:** The website must function correctly on the last two versions of major browsers
- **Maintainability:** Code must follow the company's coding standards and include documentation
- **Compliance:** The system must adhere to GDPR requirements for data protection

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Functional Requirements | Non-Functional Requirements |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Purpose | What the system does | How the system performs |
| Nature | Features and capabilities | Quality attributes and constraints |
| User Perspective | Directly visible to users | Often "behind the scenes" but affect user experience |
| Testability | Typically binary (works/doesn't work) | Often measured on a scale or against benchmarks |
| Scope | Specific functions or features | System-wide characteristics |
| Negotiability | Can often be prioritized individually | Often apply to the entire system |
| Timing | Can be implemented incrementally | Often need to be designed in from the beginning |
